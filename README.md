## Why arXiv Gram?

Scrolling through research papers shouldn't feel like a chore. So I built the TikTok-style interface you love, but filled it with the academic content you need. Scroll through papers, search for papers, save the good ones and discover papers from fields that interest you by choosing your preference.

## What Makes It Special

- **tik-tok style UI**
- **get brief insights about the paper** -so that you dont waste your time skimming through the entire paper
- **filter out fields of interest** - read only what you are curious about
- **search, like and save papers** - wanna read a paper but don't have the time rn? save it for read later
- **direct link to pdf** - paper seems interesting? visit directly
- **Researcher-Focused** - Built for academic workflows
